Sources of inspiration for PsPectrum
======================================

PsPectrum uses code and inspiration from the following sources : 

---

FUSE - Free Unix Spectrum Emulator version 0.7.0 - (C) Philip Kendall (and others)

FUSE is an Unix Spectrum emulator that is copyrighted under the GPL 
license. PsPectrum borrows freely from the source code of FUSE: 

* Allmost all parts are borrowed, but lowlevel routines (audio, graphics, etc...

If looking at the source code of PsPectrum the parts that are 
copied more or less unchanged reside in the MainCode\FUSE 
directory. 

FUSE can be found at 
http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/ or at the World of 
Spectrum http://www.worldofspectrum.org.

This document is based on the one wrote for PoketClive, an emulator based on FUSE too.


Comments
==============
PsPectrum is built using a VC 8.0 project. At the moment only sources are given,
Excep some little lowlevel psp functions for sound, and graphics an controls but I need
to talk to the one who write them (one of my programming team) in order to release them.

Some other parts like zlib, etc... can ge downloaded from inet.
